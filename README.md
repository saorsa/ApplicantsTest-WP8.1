# Basic Documentation
Satisfying the "Basic documentation" requirement, together with some code comments, I would like to note that:
I had a lot of fun implementing the requirements, though my implementation is no brain surgery.
I did some kind of Repository (a bit of onion + mvvm) architecture, though from the perspective of the hours spent it made no sense.


The solution is developed under Visual Studio 2013 and tested with Nokia Lumia 920 (WP 8.1)
